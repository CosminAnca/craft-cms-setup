## Install and set up Craft CMS locally

Author: Bob Orchard

This script assumes the following:
- You're running Mac OSX El Capitan or newer
- You have VirtualBox and Vagrant Installed already
- You use Atom for code editing
- You want to try out Craft CMS but don't want to use MAMP or a home-grown solution

**To run:**

Open a command prompt and navigate to the folder in which you'd like this Craft CMS's product folder to be (mine is ~/projects/) and run the following:

```
$ sh ./craft-setup.sh
```

You will be guided by a series of prompts that will walk you through the setup process.

**Problems or issues**

I'm still testing this solution, so if you run into any issues feel free to do a pull request.
